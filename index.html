                    A pirate is a robber who travels by water. Though most pirates targeted ships, 
                    some also launched attacks on coastal towns. We often think of pirates as swashbuckling 
                    and daring or evil and brutish, but in actual fact most of them were ordinary people 
                    who had been forced to turn to criminal activity to make ends meet.</p>
